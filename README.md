Full-stack organic e-store built with Spring Boot 4.1 microservices, MongoDB, and React 19.

## Tech stack

- Java 21, Maven multi-module
- Spring Boot 4.1.1, Spring Cloud 2025.1.3, Gateway WebMVC
- MongoDB 8 (database-per-service)
- React 19.3, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4
- Stripe Checkout (test mode)

## Services

- gateway: `8080`
- identity-service: `8081`
- catalog-service: `8082`
- cart-service: `8083`
- inventory-service: `8084`
- order-service: `8085`
- payment-service: `8086`
- review-service: `8087`
- frontend: `5173`

## Local run

Mongo only (then run services on the host as below):

```bash
docker compose up -d mongo
```

Full stack in Docker (same ports: gateway `8080`, storefront `5173`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose --profile app up --build
```

### Host processes

1. Start MongoDB with Compose as above.

2. Start backend services (each in a terminal)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./mvnw -pl gateway spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl identity-service spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl catalog-service spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl cart-service spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl inventory-service spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl order-service spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl payment-service spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl review-service spring-boot:run
```

3. Start frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Key flows

- Register/login (JWT access + refresh cookie)
- Browse categories/products, add to cart
- Checkout via payment session URL
- Payment webhook marks order paid and confirms inventory
- Verified purchasers can post reviews
- Admin endpoints for catalog, inventory, orders, payments, reviews

## CI / CD

There is no Kubernetes target in v1. **App CD is: squash-merge a green PR into `main`.** Direct pushes to `main` should be blocked by the ruleset below.

On push to `main`, Docker Bake builds every module and pushes to **GHCR** (`ghcr.io/<owner>/harvest-co/<service>:<sha>` and `:latest`). Pull requests bake without pushing. Images are not a required status check until you add **Docker** next to **CI**.

```text
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/gateway
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/identity-service
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/catalog-service
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/cart-service
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/inventory-service
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/order-service
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/payment-service
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/review-service
ghcr.io/dmarni/harvest-co/frontend
```

The Vite storefront **static `dist`** deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main` (frontend paths) or via **Actions → GitHub Pages → Run workflow**. `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot create a Pages site in this org (`Resource not accessible by integration`). An owner must enable it **once**: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**. Private repos need GitHub Pro/Team for Pages. Then re-run the workflow.

**Site URL:** [https://eco-organic-store.com](https://eco-organic-store.com) (asset `base` is `/`). The Pages workflow defaults `VITE_BASE_PATH` to `/` so JS/CSS load at `/assets/...`. Set repo variable `VITE_BASE_PATH` to `/harvest-co/` only if you drop the custom domain and use [https://marniorganicestore.github.io/harvest-co/](https://marniorganicestore.github.io/harvest-co/). After changing base or domain, re-run **Actions → GitHub Pages**. This is HTML/JS only — catalog, cart, and checkout still need a hosted gateway. Optional repo **variable** `VITE_API_BASE` prefixes `/api` calls; leave it empty for local Vite proxy. Gateway `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must include `https://eco-organic-store.com` (and `www`) if you point at a public API.

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run GitHub Actions:

| Job | What it proves |
|---|---|
| Backend | Java 21, `./mvnw -T 1C verify` across all modules |
| Frontend | `npm ci`, oxlint, TypeScript + Vite production build |
| Compose | `docker-compose.yml` is valid |
| Secrets | Gitleaks CLI scan of the commit graph (`.env.example` allowlisted; no org license) |
| CI | Aggregate gate — **this is the only required status check** |
| Docker | Bake service images; push to GHCR on `main` (not required) |
| GitHub Pages | Vite production `dist` → Pages (not a required check) |

CodeQL runs on public clones only (GitHub Advanced Security is required to upload alerts on private repos). Dependabot opens weekly grouped PRs for Maven, npm, Actions, and Compose images. Secrets stay in `.env` (see `.env.example`); they are never committed.

### GitHub ruleset — Protect main

Rulesets on a **private** repo are not enforced until the repo lives under a **GitHub Team** organization. Configure it anyway so enforcement is ready; until then, treat the workflow as policy.

Create **New ruleset → New branch ruleset** and use these values:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Ruleset Name | `Protect main` |
| Enforcement status | **Active** |
| Bypass list | **Empty** (do not add yourself — a bypass skips CI) |
| Target branches | Include **default branch** (`main`) |

**Enable these rules only:**

| Rule | Setting |
|---|---|
| Restrict deletions | On |
| Require linear history | On |
| Require a pull request before merging | On — approvals **0** (solo; raise to 1 when you have a reviewer), dismiss stale reviews **on**, require conversation resolution **on**, code owner review **off**, last-push approval **off**, allowed merge method **squash only** |
| Require status checks to pass | On — required check **`CI`**, require branch to be up to date **on** |
| Block force pushes | On |
| Automatically request Copilot code review | On — review on push **on**, review drafts **off** |

**Leave off:** Restrict creations, Restrict updates, Require deployments, Require signed commits, Require code scanning results, Require code quality results, Restrict code coverage.

Also in **Settings → General → Pull Requests**: allow **squash merge only**, disable merge commits, enable **automatically delete head branches**.

Optional second ruleset **Protect version tags**: target tags `v*`, enable Restrict updates, Restrict deletions, Block force pushes. JSON copies live in `.github/rulesets/`.

## Notes

- Internal APIs are protected with `X-Internal-Key`.
- Gateway blocks `/internal/**` from public access.
- In development without Stripe keys, payment service returns a local success URL.
